# Autonomous Decisions

## DEC-139 — 2026-07-10 — Final preservation review needs optional workflow freshness

Context: AUTO-138 could prove manifest, copied-root, and archive-package completeness, but a preserved package could still be considered complete without checking whether supplied workflow/status evidence was successful for the same commit.

Decision: Extend `forge maintenance-preservation-completeness` and `forge-maintenance-preservation-completeness` with `--status-evidence` and `--require-workflow-fresh`. The command reuses the existing commit-status review contract, requires the supplied evidence to be successful, compares its commit SHA with the written manifest commit SHA, and reports a `workflow_status` stage gate.

Alternatives considered: Create another standalone freshness command, always require status evidence, or poll GitHub workflows directly. A standalone command would fragment the final preservation decision, always requiring status evidence would break older local-only evidence sets, and polling workflows would expand the command beyond repository-local deterministic evidence review.

Consequences: Maintainers can make preservation completeness stricter when workflow evidence exists, while the default local-only preservation check remains backward compatible. The gate trusts supplied JSON and does not write files, poll GitHub, rerun workflows, stage, commit, push, prove signer identity, or prove package provenance.

Human decision still required: No.

## DEC-138 — 2026-07-10 — Preservation needs one final completeness gate

Context: AUTO-137 could verify a written archive package, but maintainers still had to inspect separate manifest, copied-root, and package verification outputs to decide whether preservation was complete.
Decision: Add `forge maintenance-preservation-completeness` and `forge-maintenance-preservation-completeness` as read-only final review commands. The command combines written manifest verification, copied archive-root verification, archive-package verification, and entry-count consistency into one `complete` or `blocked` status with `--require-complete` fail-closed behavior.
Consequences: Maintainers can review preservation readiness from one deterministic artifact while the command remains local-first and read-only.
