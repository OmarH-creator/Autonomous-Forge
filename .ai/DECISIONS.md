# Autonomous Decisions

## DEC-001 — 2026-07-07 — Start with a Python CLI

Context: Roadmap v1 defines Autonomous Forge as a local-first developer tool that needs a stable command surface before planner behavior can be used.
Decision: Use a zero-runtime-dependency Python package with a `forge` console script as the initial implementation surface.
Alternatives considered: Shell-only scripts, a hosted service, or a JavaScript package.
Consequences: Python keeps the MVP small and testable, but packaging and CLI behavior must remain simple until the plan parser exists.
Human decision still required: No.
