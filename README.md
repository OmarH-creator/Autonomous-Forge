# Autonomous Forge

Autonomous Forge is an open-source, local-first Python CLI built through an AI software-stewardship experiment. It is a **pre-alpha, human-in-the-loop maintenance safety framework**, not an unattended AI engineer.

The repository does not call an AI model itself. External agents supply autonomy; Forge supplies repository planning, policy checks, guarded side-effect gates, Git verification, and durable maintenance evidence.

## What it does

    G --> H[Guarded non-force push]
    H --> I[Post-push verification]
    I --> J[Durable evidence and history]
    J --> K[Archive and preservation]
```

Forge keeps review stages separate from stages that can change files, run commands, commit, push, or persist evidence. Side effects require explicit confirmation at the relevant boundary.

## Main capabilities

### Policy-aware planning

`forge plan` reads the repository roadmap, policy, state, and documented project files; selects the highest-priority eligible task; identifies allowed/prohibited areas; and emits a concrete reviewable plan with expected files, validation steps, risks, and reasons. It is local-first and read-only.

### Review and guarded change

Forge can build change proposals and validation plans, review planned paths against policy, inspect supplied or live tracked Git diffs, reject path escapes and malformed evidence, apply a confirmed replacement, verify the resulting target-scoped live diff, roll back on verification failure, and execute exact retained validation commands with bounded `shell=False` subprocesses.

### Verified maintenance chain

The connected workflow now includes:

- `forge verified-change-apply-run`: guarded replacement write → live-diff verification → retained validations → optional verified local commit, with separate apply/validation/commit confirmations.
- `forge verified-push-run`: verified commit → trust/status/protection readiness → separately confirmed fast-forward push → post-push verification.
- `forge verified-maintenance-run`: post-push-verified evidence → canonical durable bundle → `.ai/run-history/` link, with separate persistence confirmations.
- `forge verified-full-maintenance-run`: composes the full guarded preview/apply → validation → commit → push → post-push → durable-history lifecycle in one invocation while preserving independent authority gates for every side effect. It can derive patch readiness and change readiness in memory from existing reviewed evidence, generate the patch preview fresh from the current target/replacement, or consume the legacy persisted evidence path.

The underlying planning, diff review, patch, validation, commit, push, replay, archive, package, and preservation commands remain independently usable and reviewable.

## Evidence and preservation

Forge supports SHA-linked maintenance bundles, run-history records, replay/reviewer handoffs, archive manifests, copied archive roots, `.tar`/`.tar.gz`/`.zip` packaging, package verification, and preservation-completeness checks.

## Testing and CI

The repository workflow targets Python **3.10, 3.11, and 3.12**. It installs the package, compiles source, smoke-tests the installed CLI, validates the roadmap, and runs pytest.

AUTO-141/AUTO-142 were dedicated baseline-recovery milestones. Subsequent work connected live diff review, guarded patching, validation, commit verification, non-force push, post-push verification, and durable evidence into one maintenance workflow.

There is still no dedicated lint, type-check, coverage, or release workflow, and there are no tagged releases.

## Safety boundary

Positive controls include repository path/symlink containment, policy-aware path checks, simple secret-marker checks, explicit confirmations for every side effect, bounded `shell=False` command execution, rollback after failed post-write diff verification, SHA-256 evidence binding, complete retained-validation coverage before commit readiness, exact changed-path commit verification, fast-forward-only non-force push behavior, no tag pushes or remote/protection mutation, post-push reachability verification, and durable evidence hashing.

Important limitations remain:

- live diff review covers tracked changes, not untracked files;
- passing configured validation commands does not prove those commands are sufficient for correctness;
- commit-trust, commit-status, and branch-protection inputs are still caller-supplied evidence rather than independently acquired fresh GitHub proof;
- post-push verification relies on local remote-tracking refs unless fetch is explicitly requested;
- hashes detect byte drift but do not prove signer identity;
- secret detection is not a full secret scanner;
- there is no shared lock for external scheduled agents;
- Forge is not ready for unattended use on important repositories.

## Project memory

The `.ai` directory is the repository's engineering memory:

- `.ai/AUTONOMOUS_PLAN.md`
- `.ai/AUTONOMOUS_STATE.md`
- `.ai/AUTONOMOUS_CHANGELOG.md`
- `.ai/DECISIONS.md`

Historical branches and pull requests are inspect-before-integrate evidence only. Current stewardship works directly on `main` and does not create replacement PRs.

## Current Autonomous Status

Latest stewardship run: **AUTO-164 — refuse silent run-history overwrites**.

- **Changed:** `forge run-history-write` now protects durable `.ai/run-history/*.json` records from accidental replacement. If the requested output already exists, the write fails closed and preserves the existing bytes; callers must choose a new history path. Focused regression coverage verifies refusal and content preservation.
- **Safety:** the default is strictly more conservative. Existing history contents are preserved once the path exists; repository-root containment, `.ai/run-history/` confinement, JSON-extension enforcement, clean preflight readiness, and write confirmation remain unchanged. No network/external-service access, command execution, force-push, tag push, remote mutation, branch-protection mutation, or workflow mutation was added.
- **PR disposition:** PR #8 identified this defect correctly, but its branch is far behind current `main` and non-mergeable. The relevant safety behavior was integrated directly into current `main`; the stale PR is superseded rather than merged.
- **Validation:** the changed writer and focused AUTO-164 test module syntax-compile in the available scratch Python environment. Full local pytest remains unavailable because this runtime cannot clone from `github.com`; the repository's Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 Actions matrix remains authoritative when observable.
- **Visual updates:** none; this guard changes persistence semantics, not the maintenance lifecycle represented by the existing Mermaid diagram.
- **Current limitations:** the writer intentionally has no overwrite escape hatch and does not merge divergent record contents. Commit-trust, workflow/status, and branch-protection evidence remain caller supplied and fresh external acquisition remains policy-gated.
- **Next autonomous objective:** if AUTO-164 CI is green, continue the same end-to-end milestone with the next concrete integrity defect or caller-managed handoff reduction before commit/push; do not add another isolated read-only review command.
